								<h2 class="step-caption">Risks Related to Forex Trading.</h2>
								<div class="step-content">
									<p>Forex trading is extremely high risk and can result in significant financial losses. In particular, the trading in leveraged products such as forex can be very speculative, and losses and profits may fluctuate violently and rapidly with fluctuations in the price of the underlying spot markets. Forex trading is only suitable for experienced traders and you are expressly cautioned against engaging in this form of trading unless you understand the nature of the transaction you are entering into and the true extent of your exposure to the risk of loss.  </p>
									<p>In considering whether to engage in this form of trading, you should be aware of the following</p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>SMALL MOVEMENTS CAN HAVE BIG EFFECTS.</strong> The high degree of "gearing" or "leverage" is a particular feature of Forex trading. This stems from the margining system applicable to such trades which generally involves a comparatively modest deposit or margin in terms of the overall contract value, so that a relatively small movement in the underlying market can have a disproportionately dramatic effect on your trade. If the underlying market movement is in your favor, you may achieve a profit, but an equally small adverse market movement can quickly result in the loss of your entire deposit. </li>
										<li><strong>MARGINS.</strong> At all times during which you have open positions, you must ensure that your account balance, taking into account all running profits and losses, is equal to at least the total margin requirement that you have deposited. If the price moves against you, you may be called upon to deposit substantial additional margin, at short notice, to maintain your trade. If you do not provide such additional funds within the time required, your trade may be closed at a loss and you will be liable for any resulting deficit.</li>
										<li><strong>UNDERLYING MARKET.</strong> It is important that you understand the risks associated with trading in the relevant underlying foreign currency market because fluctuations in the price of the underlying market affect your instruments and the profitability of your trades. </li>
										<li>CHARGES. Prior to placing trades, you should ensure that you understand all charges for which you will be liable. </li>
										<li><strong>LIQUIDITY RISK.</strong> Under certain trading conditions it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This may occur, for example at times of rapid price movement if the price rises or falls in one trading session to such an extent that trading is restricted or suspended. </li>
										<li><strong>CURRENCY RISK.</strong> If you trade in a market denominated in a currency other than your base currency, fluctuations in currency exchange rates will impact your profits and losses.</li>
